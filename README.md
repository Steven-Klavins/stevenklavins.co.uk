## About 
This is the repository of my new website, I recently deployed a website just a month or so ago so you may ask why a new one already? There are a number of reasons why I felt the need for this, the first being my previous site lacked responsive design. This is something I really regretted not considering looking back on the choices I made, however I happy to say this new rendition is fully responsive across the board.

The second reason for rebuilding my site is with all honesty I rushed the project first time around and I knew I could have done better. 

The third reason was site was not hosted on a custom domain, whilst this not being crucial it was something that was bugging me. I have now bought a domain and the site is hosted via TSO host. 

The fourth reason was I hadn't implemented a CI pipeline meaning I would have to continuously have to make changes manually if I wished to update the site. 
The fifth reason for building the site from scratch was the site was very poorly optimized. A number of the components were not loading fluently and it was unusable on a mobile network. This was something I wanted to fix asap as it would not leave a good impression opening a website to broken CSS and half loaded images. 


## Technology used 
This site was built using the following tech stack. React, Javascript, Jest, Axios, Framer Motion, CSS, HTML, react-3d-viewer, react-image-gallery, Git's Rest API, and Flickr's developer API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
